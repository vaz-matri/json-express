## üì¶ Installation

### Global Installation
```bash
npm install -g @json-express/core
```

### Local Installation (Project-specific)
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
$ cd my-project

# Install locally in your project
$ npm install @json-express/core
```

## üìÅ Setup Your JSON Files

Navigate to your project directory. If you already have JSON files, you can use those directly, or create your own

Here are some examples

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
$ cd my-project

# Create an albums.json file
$ echo '[{"name": "Encore", "releaseDate": "12-11-2004"}, {"name": "The Marshall Mathers LP", "releaseDate": "23-05-2000"}]' > albums.json

# Create an artists.json file
$ echo '[{"name": "Eminem", "realName": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III", "dob": "17-10-1972", "genre": "Hip Hop", "country": "United States", "debutYear": 1996}, {"name": "Taylor Swift", "realName": "Taylor Alison Swift", "dob": "13-12-1989", "genre": "Pop", "country": "United States", "debutYear": 2006}]' > artists.json
```

ID will be added automatically!

## üöÄ Running the Server

### If you installed globally
```bash
$ json-express
```

### If you installed locally
```bash
$ npx json-express
```

### üîí HTTPS Setup

To run your server with HTTPS, configure the protocol in your `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "protocol": "https",
  "PORT": 8080
}
```

**First-time HTTPS setup requires elevated permissions** for SSL certificate generation:

- **Windows**: Run as Administrator
- **macOS**: Enter user password when prompted
- **Linux**: Run with sudo

```bash
# Windows (run as Administrator)
$ json-express

# macOS (enter password when prompted)
$ json-express

# Linux (run with sudo)
$ sudo json-express
```

After the initial certificate creation, you can run the server with normal permissions. The certificates are automatically managed and only need to be created once.

## üìö API Endpoints

Based on your JSON structure, JSON Express automatically creates RESTful endpoints:

```
GET    /albums         # Get all albums
GET    /albums/:id     # Get album with id
POST   /albums         # Create a new album
PATCH  /albums/:id     # Partially update album with id 
DELETE /albums/:id     # Delete album with id 
GET    /search         # Search across all data
```

## üè• Health Check Endpoints

JSON Express includes built-in health check endpoints to monitor your server:

```bash
# Basic health check (HTTP/HTTPS)
$ curl http://localhost:8080/health
$ curl https://localhost:8080/health

# Trusted endpoints (HTTPS only)
$ curl https://localhost:8080/api/trusted
$ curl https://localhost:8080/api/trusted-data
```

**Note**: The `/api/trusted` and `/api/trusted-data` endpoints are only available when using HTTPS protocol.

## üîç Search API

JSON Express includes a built-in search endpoint that allows you to search across your data:

```bash
# Search across all your data (HTTP)
$ curl http://localhost:8080/search?q=eminem

# Search with HTTPS
$ curl https://localhost:8080/search?q=eminem

# Search with authentication (if search is protected)
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" https://localhost:8080/search?q=eminem
```

## üîê Authentication

JSON Express supports JWT-based route-level authentication. You can secure specific routes by configuring them in your `config.json` file.

### Setting Up Authenticated Routes

Create or update your `config.json` file to include route-specific authentication:

```json
{
  "PORT": 8080,
  "protocol": "https",
  "routes": {
    "albums": {
      "auth": true
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `/albums` endpoints require authentication, while `/artists` endpoints remain public (no configuration needed for public routes).

### Getting a JWT Token

To access protected routes, you first need to obtain a JWT token by logging in:

```bash
# Login with any username and password to get JWT token (HTTP)
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password"}'

# Login with HTTPS
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password"}'
```

**Note**: You can use any username and password combination - the login endpoint accepts any credentials for development purposes.

The response will contain your JWT token:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

### Using Authenticated Routes

When a route has authentication enabled, you'll need to include the JWT token in the authorization header:

```bash
# Example: Access protected albums endpoint
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" https://localhost:8080/albums

# Example: Create a new album on protected route
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/albums \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Recovery", "releaseDate": "21-06-2010"}'

# Example: Access public artists endpoint (no token required)
$ curl https://localhost:8080/artists
```

**Note**: Replace `YOUR_JWT_TOKEN` with the actual JWT token received from the login endpoint.

## üß™ Testing Your API

You can test your API endpoints using curl

### Public Routes (No Authentication)
```bash
# Get all artists (public route)
$ curl https://localhost:8080/artists

# Get all albums (this will fail - albums is protected)
$ curl https://localhost:8080/albums

# Create a new artist (public route)
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/artists \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Drake", "realName": "Aubrey Drake Graham", "dob": "24-10-1986"}'
```

### Protected Routes (With JWT Authentication)
```bash
# First, get a JWT token by logging in
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password"}'

# Use the JWT token to access protected albums
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" https://localhost:8080/albums

# Create a new album on protected route
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/albums \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Recovery", "releaseDate": "21-06-2010"}'
```

### Health Check Testing
```bash
# Test basic health endpoint
$ curl https://localhost:8080/health

# Test trusted endpoints (HTTPS only)
$ curl https://localhost:8080/api/trusted
$ curl https://localhost:8080/api/trusted-data
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

JSON Express favors convention over configuration, but when you need customization, simply create a `config.json` file in the same directory as your JSON data files.

### Creating a Configuration File

```bash
# Create config.json in your project directory
echo '{"PORT": 8080, "protocol": "https"}' > config.json
```

### Simple Configuration ( All fields are optional )

```json
{
  "PORT": 8080,
  "protocol": "https"
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

For more advanced features like authentication and schema validation, you can extend your configuration:

```json
{
  "PORT": 8080,
  "protocol": "https",
  "schema.validation": "strict",
  "routes": {
    "albums": {
      "auth": true,
      "schema": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        },
        "releaseDate": {
          "type": "string",
          "required": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Properties

**Basic Properties:**
- **PORT** - Server port (default: 3000)
- **protocol** - Server protocol ("http" or "https", default: "http")
- **schema.validation** - Enable strict schema validation ("strict" or "loose")

**Route-Specific Properties:**
- **auth** - Enable authentication for specific routes (default: false)
- **schema** - Define validation schema for incoming data

### Schema Validation

When schema validation is enabled, JSON Express will validate incoming POST and PATCH requests against your defined schema:

```bash
# This will succeed (matches schema)
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/albums \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Recovery", "releaseDate": "21-06-2010"}'

# This will fail (missing required field)
$ curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/albums \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Recovery"}'
```

### Example Project Structure
```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json     # Optional configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ albums.json     # Your data files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artists.json    # Your data files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Example Configuration with Mixed Authentication

```json
{
  "PORT": 8080,
  "protocol": "https",
  "routes": {
    "albums": {
      "auth": true
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `/albums` endpoints require authentication, while `/artists` endpoints remain public (no configuration needed for public routes).
