## üìö API Endpoints

Based on your JSON structure, JSON Express automatically creates RESTful endpoints:

```
GET    /albums         # Get all albums
GET    /albums/:id     # Get album with id
POST   /albums         # Create a new album
PATCH  /albums/:id     # Partially update album with id 
DELETE /albums/:id     # Delete album with id 
```
<br><br>

## üìÅ Sample JSON Structure

Create as many JSON files with any number of fields as you like. ID will be added automatically!

Here's an `albums.json` file with some data:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Encore",
    "releaseDate": "12-11-2004"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Marshall Mathers LP",
    "releaseDate": "23-05-2000"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Slim Shady LP",
    "releaseDate": "23-02-1999"
  }
]
```

And an `artists.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Eminem",
    "realName": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III",
    "dob": "17-10-1972",
    "genre": "Hip Hop",
    "country": "United States",
